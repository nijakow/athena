# Athena

This is [Athena](https://github.com/nijakow/athena), a small tool to manage my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) knowledge base and help me structure my notes and thoughts.

The code was designed to work for me, and is not intended to be used on a larger scale.

## Demo

To run Athena, set up your Rust environment using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) and execute the following command in this repository:

```bash
ATHENA_VAULT_PATH="./example" cargo run
```

You can then access the local demo through the browser by visiting [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
